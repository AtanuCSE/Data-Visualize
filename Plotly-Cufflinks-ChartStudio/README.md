# Plotly + Cufflinks + Chart Studio
___

### Plotly:
Plotly's Python graphing library makes interactive, publication-quality graphs. Examples of how to make line plots, scatter plots, area charts, bar charts, error bars, box plots, histograms, heatmaps, subplots, multiple-axes, polar charts, and bubble charts. 

### Cufflinks:
There also exists an independent third-party wrapper library around Plotly called Cufflinks, which provides similar functionality (with an API closer to that of Pandas' default matplotlib backend) by adding a .iplot() method to Pandas dataframes, as it was developed before Pandas supported configurable backends.

## 01_Plotly_Histogram
*   Dataset idea using pandas plot
*   Imports and Initializations
*   **Function for vizualizing in Google Colab**

*   **Percentage** distribution histogram
*   **Normalized** Histogram (Probability Density)
*   Histogram with **Multple Group / Feature / Attribute**

## 02_Plotly_Hist_Bar
*   Histogram by group data *(Example: How many Houses contains bedrooms within range 0-4)*
*   **Overlay Histogram** *(Example: Comparison of multiple histogram in same chart)*
*   Simple Bar Plot

## 03_Plotly_Bar
*   **Frequency Bar Plot** *(Example: How many times any name (groupby) appeared in a column)*
*   **Total Bar Plot** *(Example: Total sum of money based on each name (groupby))*
*   **Normal Bar Plot** *(Example: Price for each car)*
*   **Multi-Column Normal Bar Plot** *(Example: what are the asking prices of same car in two different shops)*
